This was mainly for me to automatically add a metric fuck ton of addons and VPM back into my ALCOM after i tank it while making changes to it while not backing up. All gas, no breaks, you get the idea. So if you find yourself here, your probably looking for something else. 


The last and Final VPM nines ever needed (He said like the liar he is)

Standard VPM Listing Page, with fancy links that work (:
https://nineslastgoal.github.io/Nines-VPM-VRCSDK/index.html

Copy and past this into your Alcom Fuck VCC
https://NinesLastGoal.github.io/Nines-VPM-VRCSDK/index.json
I dont remember the code to make a link right now :( lol fix this shit nines you idiot. 

Uh nines is good boy! Woof woof!
